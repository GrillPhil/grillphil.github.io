Born 1982 in the Black Forest area in southern Germany I created my first website when I was 16. Since that time I'm all in on the design and development of user interfaces.  

After finishing high school in 2001 I founded [medialesson](http://www.medialesson.de) together with my history teacher with the mission to create CD-ROMs for history classes.  
In the early 2000s we published 3 different titles, licensed those to roughly 60% of all schools in Germany and won some nice prices, check them out [here](http://unterrichtssoftware.media-lesson.com/).  

Meanwhile I did a bachelor degree in business administration and advertising at the [University of Pforzheim](https://www.hs-pforzheim.de). We soon moved the company from my parents house to a business incubator, [Innotec](http://www.innotec-pforzheim.de/) in Pforzheim.  

2008 I got into .NET and C# when I started working with Silverlight doing numerous trainings and projects for Microsoft. My interest for the Microsoft ecosystem grew with the releases of Windows Phone and later Windows 8 with it's new app runtimes. Me and my team since designed and built various consumer and line of business apps using WinRT and now the Universal Windows Platform.

I was awarded a Microsoft Most Valuable Professional for Windows Development in 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 and had the great joy of attending the Global MVP Summit in Redmond ever since. See my MVP profile [here](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/5000176?fullName=Philipp%20%20Bauknecht).   

Today I enjoy designing and architecting client software on all platforms using UWP, Xamarin and Angular.  

When I'm AFK you will likely find me in my favorite Restaurant, [Ochsen Post](http://www.ochsenpost.de) savoring steak and wine.
